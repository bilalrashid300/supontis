We intend to take advantage of BNB Smart Chain’s robust infrastructure, it takes the safety of its users’ assets very highly and that is what we want for our users also.",
  "why_supontis_d2": "BNB Smart Chain is an incredibly fast blockchain network and it is capable of handling several transactions simultaneously without running down. BNB Smart Chain is designed to be more programmable than your conventional smart contract blockchain. It also creates new blocks every few seconds with its Proof-of-stake Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism which makes it a great platform for almost any project.",
  "why_supontis_d3": "BNB Smart Chain allows faster transaction validation which makes it very cheap to trade on the chain. We want our users to benefit from these cheap transaction costs and have it be one less thing to worry about.",
